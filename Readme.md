This is a Library Management System Software named Libreria.
It was a group term project for the course Software Engineering at IIT Kharagpur under prof. Dr. Partha Pratim Das. I developed it along with one of my fellow batchmates, Ashrujit Ghoshal.

It has been developed using Java and MySql.
All the codes pertaining to UI and backend have been provided along with the Software requirement specifications and the testing documents.
